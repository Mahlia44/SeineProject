from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

## Datasets Instructions

All the datasets are to be found on NAS, an online storage server, at this address: https://urwaters.quickconnect.to/. 
You should download the following files: biol_data, phychem_data, geo_data and Qgis.

You should then place the files in the current repository, without pushing them on GitHub (they are too heavy).

The construction of the whole repository should be as follows.

## biol_data

Contains biological raw and processed data

## phychem_data

Contains physico-chemical raw and processed data

## geo_data

Contains geographic raw and processed data divided in sub groups 
- watershed data
- land use land cover (LULC) data
- population data
- river data


## python_codes

Contains all python codes used in the project

## Qgis

Contains files useful for Qgis

## results_figures

Saved figure and plots
